### Data

Dying Inside: The Hidden Crisis in Americaâ€™s Jails, Published October 2020. [Reuters News](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/#article-data-key-findings)

### Process

Two datasets were used, 1 with data about the jails and population, the other with data for each person and demographics. To make these graphs, both CSV files were combined into one file using the left_join function. To clean the data, all the empty instances were changed to NA and the shortened variables were mapped to full words using cause_mapping.
