U.S. Department of Justice\n\n\nProcess\nThe data was pulled from two CSV files published by Reuters News and merged into 1 dataset; 1 with data about the jails and population, the other with data for each person and demographics. To make these graphs, both CSV files were combined into one file using the left_join function. To clean the data, all the empty instances were changed to NA and the shortened variables were mapped to full words using cause_mapping and race_mapping. For the pie chart, since the data for each race did not add up to 100, the total percentage was calculated using sum(jail_population$Death_Percentage) and this normalized each percentage by dividing by this total and multiplying by 100.\nChat GPT and Claude were also used as a part of troubleshooting this project.\n\n\nPackages Used:\ntidyverse\nggplot2- Making plots\ngganimate- Animating plots\nleaflet- Interactive map\ndplyr- Filtering data\nsf- US states data for mapping"

Journalists from Reuters filed 1,500 public records, and made sure to obtain data from the 10 largest jails in each state. This data covers 523 jails over the U.S. and further looks into these deaths."

    "text": "Causes\n\n\n\nCause of Death Plot\n\n\nThe highest causes of death in American jails are medical issues, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse. 1 in 10 people die in American jails because of addictions and more than 25% of the deaths were suicides. These issues are almost completely unaddressed behind bars.\n\n\nDeath Rate\n\n\n\nYear vs. Death Plot\n\n\nOver the years, the death rate seems to get worse. There is a slight decrease in 2019, which could mean conditions are improving. While there is an increase in the death rates because of public jails switching to private healthcare, bad jail conditions, and an overlooking of prisoners’ health, a small part of this increase could also be because of the increasing jail population.\n\n\nRace\nA portion of the deaths are caused by officer aggression. A specific example is African American Harvey Hill, who had an undiagnosed mental illness, was not given an examination after showing signs, and ended up dying after getting beaten by guards and was not given medication in the infirmary.\n\n\n\nRace vs. Death Plot\n\n\nThis graph shows if there is a high amount of deaths within a specific race to see if there was extreme racial discrimination against non-white people. But, the highest amount of deaths are White, which could be because the majority of the jail population is white. To see if this is the case, the percentage of deaths per population of that race was calculated for the year 2019:\n\n\n\nRace Ratios Plot\n\n\nThis is completely different from the last graph, and it shows that more Asians have died per Asian population, followed by White, Black, Hispanic, and then finally Native American. This graph does not take Pacific Islanders, Native Hawaiians, or unidentifiable people.\n\n\nFinal Conclusion\nThe death rates in U.S. jails have increased significantly from 2008-2019, with notable disparities based on race, cause of death, and state. The race that had the most deaths was White, but the race that had the most deaths per population was Asian. The highest causes of death were medical issues, suicide, and drug/alcohol abuse. The state that had the most jail deaths was California."
