Journalists from Reuters filed 1,500 public records, and made sure to obtain data from the 10 largest jails in each state. This data covers 523 jails over the U.S. and further looks into these deaths."

    "text": "Causes\nThe highest causes of death in jails over America are medical issues, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse. More than 25% of the deaths were suicides and 10% were because of addictions. These issues are almost completely unaddressed behind bars.\n\n\n\nCause of Death Plot\n\n\n\n\nDeath Rate\nOver the years, the death rate seems to get worse. There is a slight decrease in 2019, which could mean conditions are improving. While there is an increase in the death rates because of public jails switching to private healthcare, bad jail conditions, and an overlooking of prisoners’ health, a small part of this increase could also be because of the increasing jail population.\n\n\n\nYear vs. Death Plot\n\n\n\n\nRace\nA portion of the deaths are caused by officer aggression. A specific example is African American Harvey Hill, who had an undiagnosed mental illness, was not given an examination after showing signs, and ended up dying after getting beaten by guards and was not given medication in the infirmary. This graph shows if there is a high amount of deaths within a specific race to see if there was extreme racial discrimination against non-white people. But, the highest amount of deaths are White, which could be because the majority of the jail population is white.\n\n\n\nRace vs. Death Plot"
