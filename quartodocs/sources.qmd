### Data

Dying Inside: *The Hidden Crisis in Americaâ€™s Jails*, Published October 2020. [Reuters News](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/#article-data-key-findings)[ Justice](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ji19.pdf)

Bureau of Justice Statistics: *Jail Inmates in 2019*, Published March 2021. [U.S. Department of Justice](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ji19.pdf)

### Process

The data was pulled from two CSV files published by Reuters News and merged into 1 dataset; 1 with data about the jails and population, the other with data for each person and demographics. To make these graphs, both CSV files were combined into one file using the `left_join` function. To clean the data, all the empty instances were changed to `NA` and the shortened variables were mapped to full words using `cause_mapping` and `race_mapping`. For the pie chart, since the data for each race did not add up to 100, the total percentage was calculated using `sum(jail_population$Death_Percentage)` and this normalized each percentage by dividing by this total and multiplying by 100.

Chat GPT and Claude were also used as a part of troubleshooting this project.
