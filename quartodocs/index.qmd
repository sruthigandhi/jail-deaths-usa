# **Introduction**

The U.S. Government does not release jail mortality data, which keeps the public in the dark about the high death rates in American jails. Journalists from Reuters filed 1,500 public records, and made sure to obtain data from the 10 largest jails in each state. This data covers 523 jails over the U.S. and further looks into these deaths.
