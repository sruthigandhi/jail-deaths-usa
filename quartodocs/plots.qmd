#### Causes

![Cause of Death Plot](cause.gif)

The highest causes of death in American jails are medical issues, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse. 1 in 10 people die in American jails because of addictions and more than 25% of the deaths were suicides. These issues are almost completely unaddressed behind bars.

#### Death Rate

![Year vs. Death Plot](year.png)

Over the years, the death rate seems to get worse. There is a slight decrease in 2019, which could mean conditions are improving. While there is an increase in the death rates because of public jails switching to private healthcare, bad jail conditions, and an overlooking of prisoners' health, a small part of this increase could also be because of the increasing jail population.


#### Race

A portion of the deaths are caused by officer aggression. A specific example is African American Harvey Hill, who had an undiagnosed mental illness, was not given an examination after showing signs, and ended up dying after getting beaten by guards and was not given medication in the infirmary.

This graph shows if there is a high amount of deaths within a specific race to see if there was extreme racial discrimination against non-white people. But, the highest amount of deaths are White, which could be because the majority of the jail population is white. To see if this is the case, the percentage of deaths per population of that race was calculated for the year 2019:

This is completely different from the last graph, and it shows that more Asians have died per Asian population, followed by White, Black, Hispanic, and then finally Native American. This graph does not take Pacific Islanders, Native Hawaiians, or unidentifiable people.

#### Final Conclusion

The death rates in U.S. jails have increased significantly from 2008-2019, with notable disparities based on race, cause of death, and state. The race that had the most deaths was White, but the race that had the most deaths per population was Asian. The highest causes of death were medical issues, suicide, and drug/alcohol abuse. The state that had the most jail deaths was California.
